### Overview
More flexible than Stata and Matlab, easier than C, more tailored to statistical analysis than Python, R is a great option for economists. Paired with modern packages and a personalized workflow, you can use R to efficiently clean, analyze, and visualize large amounts of data. We will start from the foundations of coding in R, building up to graphing, mapping, and other outputs from statistical testing. Throughout, we will discuss and practice the tenants of successful coding, including clarity, simplicity, and generality. The workflow can define the work; you will develop your own workflow that allows you to organize your code and research. Your workflow skills will be useful to you even in other languages and programs. The capstone project is an independent research project on a topic of your choosing, or a replication of a published economics paper. 

This class is designed for Ph.D. students and master’s students interested in pursuing empirical research in economics. It fulfills half of the coding requirement for Ph.D. students (1.5 credits). The prerequisites are fulfilled by ECON 701-707. The programing assignments will require a working understanding of hypothesis testing, linear regression, maximum likelihood estimators, and Bellman equations. No prior coding experience is necessary. 


### Student Learning Objectives

After completing this course, successful students will learn to
* apply if/else logic, for/when loops, write functions, and debug/optimize code to perform statistical analysis and visualize results;
* utilize tools (git, RNotebook, \LaTeX, code documentation and journaling) to conduct effective research;
* search and evaluate online resources and select appropriate R commands; and
* design and execute an independent research project proposal or replication exercise.

### Online Learning
I designed the materials so that the majority of the learning occurs during class time. If you need to miss a session, recordings of the classes will be made available. You must turn in your work from the exercises in these recordings to receive participation credit. While this option is available, I strongly encourage you to attend class at the designated time to get the most out of the class. Please email me if you are unable to attend a session.

By now, you are all probably very accustomed to Zoom. If I experience any connectivity issues and the meeting closes, please stick around for at least 10 minutes to see if I can reconnect. Feel free to have your cameras off at any point. It is much easier for the class to run if everyone has their cameras on, but I understand that this is not always possible. I will monitor chats and hand raising, but also please interject whenever. I will always start at 5:01, so please try to log in by then. I commit to always offer a 5 minute break and end by 7:05.

### Academic Integrity
While you can confer with your peers for programming assignments and the capstone project, everyone must turn in their own unique work. Assignments verified to have identical or very similar code will receive no credit. Going through the exercises yourself ensures you fully understand the material.

### Accommodations
I am committed to ensuring that everyone can succeed in this class. Students with disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in the class are encouraged to contact the Student Disabilities Access Office at (919) 668-1267 or disabilitie@aas.duke.edu as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

### Assessments

#### In-Class Participation (15\% of grade)
We will use class time to learn about the building blocks of R code, specific packages and commands, and workflow tools. There will be a focus on individual practice as well as traditional lecturing to keep the long class period engaging and educational. As a result, your participation is necessary for a productive classroom environment. All synchronous and asynchronous in-class work will be turned in and graded for completion.

#### Homeworks (25\% of grade)
There are three homeworks to be completed independently outside of class. They are due on Mondays before the start of class.

Assignments must be compiled in RNotebook and submitted via Git. A rubric for programming assignments is available [here](https://github.com/r-for-economists/Syllabus/blob/main/Rubrics.pdf).

#### Capstone Project (60\% of grade) 
This final project allows you to use R in a context of your interest. You can select an original research proposal or a replication for this project. A proposal detailing your project plan will be due halfway through the class. A description and rubric for the capstone project is available [here](https://github.com/r-for-economists/Syllabus/blob/main/Rubrics.pdf). 

##### Option 1: Research Proposal
You will propose an original research question. Your project must include a motivation for why your question is of scientific  interest, a description of your data or simulation, and an explanation of your methods and results.

##### Option 2: Replication
You will select a published paper of interest to you and download or simulate the data. Your project will include a summary of the paper and the specific results you are replicating. The replication code should be original; You cannot turn in published code you downloaded.
